<br>When you visit Abbott Kitchen Center'&nbsp; showroom, a designer will
be on staff to help you create your dream kitchen. This trained designer
will be prepared to guide you through the kitchen planning process and
answer any questions you may have. One way you can make this initial meeting
more effective is to bring with you the basic measurements of your kitchen.
If you don’t feel comfortable completing this step, don’t worry - it’s
not a requirement. However, by being prepared to share this information
with the designer up front, the two of you will be able to discuss the
specifics of your project at an earlier stage. As a safeguard, make sure
the designer comes to your home to doublecheck all measurements before
placing the actual cabinet order.

<p><i>To get started you’ll need the following tools: 25 foot metal tape
measure, Note pad or clipboard and Pens and pencils in different colors</i></center>

<br>1. On a separate blank piece of paper, draw an outline of the room.
<br>2. Measure all wall lengths in both directions, writing the dimensions
down in inches and fractions. Double check all measurements, making sure
each figure is accurate.
<br>3. Begin in one corner and measure to windows and doors, going to the
outside edges of the trim moulding. Note the width of the moulding. Do
this from each corner in each direction, until you’ve measured the entire
room.
<br>4. Determine the ceiling height, measuring in several spots in case
the floor is uneven. Write the ceiling height (in inches) on your floor
plan and circle it. Note if there are any existing soffits.
<br>5. Locate existing plumbing, electrical, and lighting hookups, measuring
their distance from each wall and from the floor. Include locations of
any new ones you are going to add. Also indicate whether the kitchen doors
open in or out. Plumbing for sink, range hook-up, electrical uutlets, light
switches, heating/air vents and phone jacks should also be noted.
<br>6. If you plan to use existing appliances, record the dimensions of
each. If you are purchasing new appliances, note their brand name and model
number. Also make a note of non-permanent items, like chairs and tables.
Having these measurements on hand will remind the designer to make room
for them as they begin to plan your kitchen.</td>
