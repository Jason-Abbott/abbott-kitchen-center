<br>Understanding the basic principles of kitchen layout will help take
much of the mystery out of the design process. One of the most basic layout
principles is the <i>work triangle</i>. The <i>work triangle</i> is an
imaginary line drawn from each of the three primary work stations in the
kitchen - <i>the food storage, preparation/cooking, and clean-up stations</i>.
By drawing these lines, you can assess the distance required to move to
and from each area and thus determine how well the traffic will flow. To
help avoid traffic flow problems, work triangles should have a perimeter
that measures less than 26 feet.
<p>The three primary kitchen work stations which create the <i>work triangle</i>
are:
<p><img SRC="work-station.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=203 width=250 align=LEFT><b>1.</b>
<i>The food storage station</i> - Your refrigerator and pantry are the
major items here. Cabinetry like lazy susan or swing-out pantry units add
function and convenience. Options like wine racks, spice racks, and roll-out
trays help to organize your groceries.
<p><b>2.</b> <i>The preparation/cooking station</i> - Your range, oven,
microwave, and smaller appliances are found in this area. Counter space
is important in this section. Conserve space by moving appliances off the
counter with appliance garage cabinets and space-saving ideas like towel
rods and pot lid racks.
<p><b>3.</b> <i>The clean-up station</i> - Everyone's least favorite activity
is one of the kitchen's most important - clean-up. This area is home to
the sink, waste disposal, and dishwasher. Cabinetry for this station is
designed to organize with the trash bin cabinet and roll-out tray baskets
for storage convenience.
<p>Today's kitchens are more than just places to cook and eat meals. Many
people choose to include breakfast bars, desks, bookshelves, computer stations,
phone and message centers, and mini entertainment areas in their kitchens.
Consider adding these areas to your kitchen with our selection on desk,
shelf, bookcase, and entertainment cabinetry units.

<br>Since the kitchen is one of the most active work areas of the home,
it is important to select the right layout to complement your lifestyle
and taste. There are five primary kitchen layout shapes - <i>the U-Shaped,
L-Shaped, Island, G-Shaped, Corridor/Gallery, and Single Wall shapes</i>.
After learning about the <i>work triangle</i> in the section "Understanding
Basic Kitchen Layout," you will now see how the <i>work triangle</i> functions
in each layout and the advantages each layout offers.

<td><b><i>The Island Option.</i></b> Islands are extremely popular in homes
today and are most often seen in L-Shaped kitchens. Islands can not only
keep work areas traffic-free, but also create a wealth of extra counter
and storage space. An island can be an indispensable food preparation station
or act as a butcher block area. The island is also an ideal place to add
an extra sink or an island grill.</td>
